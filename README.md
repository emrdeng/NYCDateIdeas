# NYCDateIdeas
NYC Date Idea Randomizer

A web app that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that users can input their date preferences including: 1) the date they are planning their date, 2) cuisine type/preference (sushi, steak, etc.), and 3) price range.

The app will randomly generate 1) a NYC date activity (museum, park, paintball, etc.), 2) a restaurant within walking distance, and 3)a bakery/coffee and tea/bar place depending on whether the user would like that extra preference.

Don't like the idea that was generated? You can selectively regenerate any of the generated options based on the user preference.
